# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates a deep learning model that recognizes handwritten digits from the famous [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for image-related tasks like digit classification.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) into their corresponding categories using CNNs. CNNs are well-suited for image recognition tasks because of their ability to learn spatial hierarchies and features through multiple layers of convolution and pooling.

## Dataset

We use the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is split into:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images

Each image is of size 28x28 pixels and corresponds to a digit between 0 and 9.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling and fully connected layers. The key components are:

- **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply filters to the input image to detect different features like edges, textures, and shapes.
- **Pooling Layers**: These layers down-sample the image, reducing its size and complexity while retaining the most important information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: After several convolution and pooling operations, the output is flattened and passed through fully connected layers to perform the final classification.
- **Activation Function**: ReLU activation is used in the hidden layers, and softmax is used for the output layer to classify the digits.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The images are normalized and reshaped to fit the model input dimensions.
2. **Model Construction**: A CNN model is built with several layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
3. **Training**: The model is trained using the training data for a fixed number of epochs.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on the test data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in recognizing handwritten digits. The trained model can accurately classify digits with high accuracy, making it suitable for applications such as digit recognition systems in checks, forms, and more.
